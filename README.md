# Decidel - Smarter Hacker News Client

The Hacker News client that reads between the lines. Decidel brings AI-powered summaries, smart topic filtering, and a beautiful reading experience to your favorite tech community.

## AI Summaries That Actually Help

Tap any story to instantly surface key points, counterarguments, expert insights, and cited sources — without scrolling through hundreds of comments. Long threads, understood in seconds.

## Your Feed, Your Rules

Mute topics you don't care about with AI-powered semantic filtering. Use built-in filters for Crypto, Politics, and more — or build your own. Swipe to bookmark, share, or mark stories as read.

## Powerful Search & Discovery

Browse Top, Best, New, Ask HN, and Show HN. Search all of Hacker News with filters for relevance, recency, and popularity. Save searches for quick access anytime.

## Threaded Discussions

Clean, readable comment threads with sort options — Best, Newest, or Most Controversial. Search within any discussion to find exactly what you need.

## Beautiful & Customizable

Light, Dark, Black (OLED), and Sepia themes with scheduled day/night switching. Adjust font style and size to make reading feel just right.

## Offline & Exportable

Bundle bookmarks for offline reading, then export stories and summaries to Markdown, Notion, or Obsidian — your research, your way.

## Your AI, Your Keys

Connect OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, or Groq with your own API key. API keys are stored securely in the iOS Keychain and never leave your device.

## Also Includes

Reading history, link previews for GitHub, arXiv & Wikipedia, compact and full display modes, story submission, comment replies, and user profiles.
